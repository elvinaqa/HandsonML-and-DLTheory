In today's data community, there is some ambiguity about the difference between analysis and analytics. That even happens among HR managers of the companies, finding it hart to differentiate between two, making flaws about finding Data Analytics Speacialists or Data Analysts. Knowing which one is who can definitely help to both sides during job interviews or applications.

Basically, Analysis is about chunking the whole data into small parts to do simpler investigations. One important point to mention about the difference is the PAST data. When doing Data Analysis, we have searching for the reasons about why we have such values in the data, why the value raised or downfell, what are the causes, and how it happened (ex: Stock price).

Talking about Analytics, it is about exploration of th potential future events rather than explaining the reasons of past events. All in all, we definitely need to do some analysis, before we can do analysis or predictions about future probabilities from current patterns.
We have 2 types of Analytics which are Qualitative and Quantitative

Qualitative Analytics is deciding upon your intuition and analysis of the data before you make next business move.
Quantitative, however, is the type of analytics where we decide based off of the algorithms and formulas.
Simple example would be about the clothing store owner. When he wants to decide which clothes to advertise during the year, he has 2 options to opt from. The first way is about reading newspapers, online articles to know more about the people's choice about the trends in terms of clothing. This is the Qualitative way of deciding on your business move.
Next option is about doing investigations on the past sales, following patterns during different months and deciding which clothes to advertise to grab the attention of the customers which is the way when we do Quantitative Analsysis.
