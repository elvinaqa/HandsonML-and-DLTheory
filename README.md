# The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data
In a famous paper published in 2001, Microsoft researchers Michele Banko and Eric
Brill showed that very different Machine Learning algorithms, including fairly simple
ones, performed almost identically well on a complex problem of natural language disambiguation

## The importance of data versus algorithms
As the authors put it: “these results suggest that we may want to reconsider the tradeoff between spending time and money on algorithm development versus spending it
on corpus development.”
The idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems was further
popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a paper titled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness
of Data” published in 2009.10 It should be noted, however, that small- and mediumsized datasets are still very common, and it is not always easy or cheap to get extra
training data, so don’t abandon algorithms just yet.
